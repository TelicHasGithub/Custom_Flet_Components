## App_Bar.py

This app bar is intended to replace the default windows app bar and has the ability to add buttons for menus and such
for added functionality in addition to custom minimize, maximize and close buttons for window functionality.

The empty space is draggable so you can reposition the window.

Adding no controls or an empty list to the app bar buttons results in no draggable area.
